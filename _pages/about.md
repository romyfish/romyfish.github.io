Hi there
======
I am a first-year PhD student at [the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), very fortunate to be supervised by 
[Dr. Stephen Lindsay](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/stephenlindsay/), [Dr. Xianghua (Sharon) Ding](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/xianghuading/), and [Dr. Mary Ellen Foster](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/maryellenfoster/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Technology at [the South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, and the Master's degree in Robotics & AI at [the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2023. Despite having a STEM background, I've always been fascinated by psychology and the relationship between humans and machines, and my research interest includes Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Conversational Interfaces, AI, NLP, LLM, Digital Healthcare Support, Computational Social Science.

My Research
------
I currently focus on leveraging emerging digital technologies to enhance the effectiveness of peer support organizations. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with relevant healthcare services, working alongside practitioners to co-design an intelligent chatbot which can facilitate peer support communities on social platforms. Acknowledging that robots can never fully replace human interaction, my ultimate goal is to make chatbots and other advanced technologies serve as thoughtful assistants for humans, reducing both physical and emotional workloads and making life easier for individuals and society in practice.

I've built an initial web-based chatbot prototype <img src="/images/robot.png" alt="ferrybot" title="ferrybot" style="width:25px; height:auto;" />
 [Ferrybot](https://ferrybot.eu.pythonanywhere.com/) demonstrating the potential of integrating chatbots into the peer support framework, and we believe it promises to revolutionize the field. Hope you have fun playing with it and please don't hesitate to reach out at any time!
